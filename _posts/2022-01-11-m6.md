# Intro

Our target customers are VR headset owners, users of the Steam platform, which are passionate about puzzle & horror games.

As statistics show, [Steam](https://backlinko.com/steam-users) is a very successful platform:
- ~120 million monthly active players
- ~62.6 million people use Steam on a daily basis
- 31.3 billion hours of playtime in 2020

Also, Steam survey data suggests that [~3 million users](https://www.roadtovr.com/monthly-connected-headsets-steam-3-million-march-2021/) (2.4%) own VR headsets, but this market is enjoying a rapidly growing interest rate, with hardware prices getting lower and quality getting better over time. As of 2020, [171 million VR headsets](https://techjury.net/blog/virtual-reality-statistics/#gref) are owned by consumers globally and this number is expected to keep growing rapidly.

The video game industry tends to have a different behaviour than other industries, mainly because it is very developed (even overly developed at times), there is rarely a truly innovative and genuine idea, and it is almost impossible to keep track of all the similarities.

This is the reason why we have tried to pick a balanced amount of main competitors in the VR field, being very selective after identifying and analysing a lot of games, but also taking into consideration games focused solely on the horror or puzzle genre.

As trying to determine the approximate number of players / competitors in our targeted market, we have decided to conduct two researches: one that tackles the general overview concerning the VR-only market on Steam and one that analyses our cherry-picked main VR competitors.

# General VR-only overview

5187 VR-only games available for buying today on Steam
3 million Steam users that own a VR headset
⇒ 3 million players / 5187 games

# Competitors’ market share

# Our potential market share

Since our competition consists mainly of AAA titles or sensationally successful indie games, our potential market share estimation isn't that comparable to theirs. So, taking all of those things into consideration, we have objectively estimated the following:

# The value of our market share

As statistics suggest, global VR video gaming revenues reached [$22.9B](https://techjury.net/blog/virtual-reality-statistics/#gref) in 2020.

As the validation process has highlighted, players prefer buying a game that is on sale rather than paying the full price. As such, we’re planning on implementing frequent minimal sales and our calculations take into consideration the interval of 16-18€.

# Conclusion

The conducted research has put into light few interesting aspects:
- Availability is a key-factor regarding the number of copies sold. The two VR-only games (both indie and AAA) among our competitors have recorded significantly fewer downloads than the ones supporting both PC and VR gameplays. This particular insight motivated us to further investigate the possibility of also implementing a PC version of the game besides our main VR focus.
- The popularity of the Steam platform complies to our needs and offers us an important market opening
- The growing interest towards VR technologies represents a notable advantage for our business
