# Project Description

## Roadmap

## The Team

## The Problem
Video games are starting to feel stale nowadays. There can be no doubt that the entertainment industry could always benefit from innovative ideas and new twists on classic designs. We believe that the genre that benefits the most from virtual reality is horror. The extra immersion gained from a complete field of view serves to communicate fear and tension in a much more visceral way.

## Value Proposition
By choosing to play our games, you have the get to experience a whole new reality. You move past the limits of the plastic frames around your screen and have the opportunity to truly interact with your environment and experience a character's story first-hand.

## Customer Segments
We target a niche-market customer segment. Our customers are people who regularly play and enjoy either puzzle games, horror games or both and feel the need to elevate their experience. Moreover, those we target need to own a VR headset and a PC capable of running VR games. These restrictions mean that they are willing to spend a notable amount of money on their hobby, a fact that can be taken into consideration when developing a business model.

## Competition
<img src="Competition.jpg" width="100%">

## Advantage Over The Competition
It takes a considerable time investment and a certain headspace to begin playing an AAA game. Sessions tend to only be fun if you have enough time to get completely immersed and absorbed into the experience, not to mention the high price point. AAA games need to be purchased every time one wants a new experience, and the financial investment can quickly add up.

Murder Hotel aims to be the base for a suite of similar, yet different bite sized games that can be purchased at lower price points, individually. Moreover, their short length and single-session play length allow this type of game to fit into a busy schedule much easier that an expensive, heavy AAA game would at a considerably lower price point. PC VR users do presumably have money to spend, but 5 AAA games can easily surpass the price of a headset while not offering much variety.

## Key Metrics
Given the fact that our long-term goal is to create an engaging suite of games based on the same principle, the aspects we should focus on are related to user gain and multiple games purchases.
- Daily new users
- Daily active users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Returning users: users that purchased and played multiple games from us
- Average Session Length: offers insight on the users’ attention span and engagement level

Other metrics, based on a stable audience, are not applicable or relevant for puzzle games with a premium monetization scheme.


## Cost Structure
**Product cost**: hardware (fixed) 

**Service cost**: software licenses (fixed), server maintenance (fixed), art & audio outsourcing (variable, need-based)

**Product line cost**: publisher commissions

**Customer cost**: product returns (variable), physical deluxe editions (fixed)

## Revenue Streams
Transaction-based revenue: the games will be sold premium, at a price point around 15€ in order to keep the commitment of buying another game low and encouraging customers to return to our games repeatedly, while still feeling that their spending is minimal.

# Idea Validation

* Customer Delivery - Overview

In order to gain more insights on what particular features of our product will appeal to our clients and how much will they interact with our game as well, we decided we needed a customer segmentation. We used ***behavioural segmentation*** for this, because of the nature of our product (a game) and because of the fact that the more we predict the purchasing decisions of our customer, the more revenue our project gets.

* Customer Detail - Process

The next step was to conduct the survey, through Google Forms, and the question groups were:

1. Do you own a VR headset?
2. Are you interested in playing a VR game, even if you don't already own a headset?

>Aimed to show us the general interest people have for a VR game.

3. How much do horror games appeal to you?
4. How much do puzzle games appeal to you?

>This goes even deeper into the two genres of the game. We want to see if they are of equal interest to our customers without one overpowering the other.

5. How often do you play video games?
6. And when you are playing, how often is it that you are playing a horror video game?
7. If you answered between 1 to 5 to the previous question, when do you prefer to play horror video games?

>This categorises customers that will interact with our game on set times. We can use this information to market our game during these periods.

8. Which of these features would make your gaming experience unique?

>Segmenting by benefits sought shows us what experience would our customers want more. With that in mind we can push prioritised features first so that our game gains more following at launch.

9. What makes you lose interest in a video game far too early?

>We also need to know the deal breakers for our clients. We want to make sure that people play our game for as long as possible.

10. What makes you invest in a video game?

>This question is meant to reveal the factors that make our undecided clients push that "purchase" button. With that in mind, we can take certain actions, such as deal, knowing that they will bring more profit,

11. How much would you be willing to spend on an indie VR game?
>Straightforward question that will reveal if our price estimation was realistic enough.

12. Is there something else you wish to see in a VR video game?
>Typical open question to make sure that no client input is left unheard.

13. How old are you?
> Although not a behavioural question, this helps us identify age groups and see if responses vary from one to another.

* Customer Detail - Results

Looking over our ***28 responses*** submitted in the past week we can make the following conclusions:

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/1.jpg "Do you own a VR headset?")
![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/2.jpg "Are you interested in playing a VR game, even if you don't already own a headset?")

Although not many people own a VR headset, there was an overwhelmingly positive response to wanting to experiment our VR game. As VR headsets are getting more accessible, or easier to borrow, our game will surely get to our customers.

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/3.jpg "How much do horror games appeal to you?")
![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/4.jpg "How much do puzzle games appeal to you?")

With this question we were trying to verify if both game elements equally appeal to the players, making sure that neither of them retain them from playing the game. As it seems, they are quite balanced.

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/5.jpg "How often do you play video games?")
![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/6.jpg "And when you are playing, how often is it that you are playing a horror video game?")
![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/7.jpg "If you answered between 1 to 5 to the previous question, when do you prefer to play horror video games?")

What we get from this part of the survey is that over 50% of people play video games weekly or even more frequently, but it's not very often that it's a horror game. That means that in our marketing strategy we should highlight that it has two genres, so that it appeals to both horror and non-horror gamers.
Moreover, when people are playing horror games they prefer doing it during the night, to enhance their experience. This leaves room for us to make certain decisions such as events or bonuses during nigh-time.

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/8.jpg "Which of these features would make your experience unique?")

First to notice is that there is not much of an interest in having a pack of games. That means we will reconsider this after launching the game. Instead, we can focus on having consequences and unique horror through auditory-visual illusions.
There was a positive response to having a self paced game and having little to no instructions, which will definitely set us apart from the competition.

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/9.jpg "What makes you lose interest in a video game far too early?")

Here, our main concerns with other VR video games align with our customers. This further confirms that our product is desired, and that delivering the features we intend to, will make customers spend more time in our game.

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/10.jpg "What makes you invest in a video game?")
From what it seems, having a Halloween discount and making the game free for a period of time, will surely attract more customers.

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/11.jpg "How much would you be willing to spend on an indie VR game?")
The price range selected by more than 50% is our proposed price range or more.

![Google Forms screenshot](/questions/13.jpg "How old are you?")

Variations between age groups were very little, which means that our customers act independently of their age.

* Customer Detail - Conclusions

Although some of our initial ideas like having a pack of games or catering the game to a horror audience didn't translate as well as we thought, we were pretty aligned with what our customers want. Knowing what features they want to see more, makes us prioritise certain things for the Customer Validation Stage. We surely know what attracts customers, making our marketing strategy easier.

# Wireframe
The object of the game is to solve a number of puzzles and escape the hotel.

## Level 1 - Attic
The first level is in the attic, where H.H. Holmes has trapped you, the player. After looking around the room, you find an odd looking oil lamp. Looking around some more, a note on the desk suggests using the oil lamp on an basic "hidden text" element, serving as an immersive tutorial on how to use the oil lamp to reveal invisible text. Following the revealed instructions, it becomes clear that you should look for a key hidden in the bookcase. The key unlocks the door and you are now free to roam the hotel.

## Level 2 - Hotel
The second level is the main hotel area, spanning two floors. Here, you are supposed to roam around while avoiding Holmes himself who appears in certain areas, either guiding you in the right direction or deterring you from reaching an objective. Holmes' apparitions also serve as a "breadcrumb trail" towards the objective: a photograph containing the puzzle for this level. Looking at the photograph leads you to an identical area in the hotel, except for one difference. Something is missing in the actual room, and investigating it leads you to a trap door, connecting to the basement.

## Level 3 - Basement
The third and last level takes place in the basement. Looking around there is a locked door and it is hinted at that you should look for invisible writing on the wall, using the oil lamp. Once the writing is found, it leads you to a key that unlocks the door. Behind the door, there is another trap door that leads outside. Using it leads to freedom, the game is over!

# Landing Page
In terms of our website's landing page, we decided to get help from Adobe XD, because of its easy prototyping and the possibility to export the whole thing to HTML and CSS files or even to a React project using Anima.

##### [Our Adobe XD Landing Page](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c18cd843-cd7c-4ad7-b545-360d96365b5a-94df/)

An XD project usually starts with a defined color palette, for which we chose grey-based colors and a pop of a vibrant red.
The navigation bar contains easy to access information, including links to buying or testing the game.

The main scrollview is composed of 5 components:
* The video ribbon, which contains YouTube videos that act as video presentations for our game and our work.
* The information ribbon, which has a short description of the product.
* The Twitch scrollable ribbon, which shows people currently playing the game, making the product more desirable.
* The deal scrollable ribbon, which is composed of deals, which seem to be the number one determination of purchasing games, according the the survey conducted in M2.
* The footer ribbon.
