### The Problem
Video games are starting to feel stale nowadays. There can be no doubt that the entertainment industry could always benefit from innovative ideas and new twists on classic designs. We believe that the genre that benefits the most from virtual reality is horror. The extra immersion gained from a complete field of view serves to communicate fear and tension in a much more visceral way.

### Value Proposition
By choosing to play our games, you have the get to experience a whole new reality. You move past the limits of the plastic frames around your screen and have the opportunity to truly interact with your environment and experience a character's story first-hand.

### Customer Segments
We target a niche-market customer segment. Our customers are people who regularly play and enjoy either puzzle games, horror games or both and feel the need to elevate their experience. Moreover, those we target need to own a VR headset and a PC capable of running VR games. These restrictions mean that they are willing to spend a notable amount of money on their hobby, a fact that can be taken into consideration when developing a business model.
